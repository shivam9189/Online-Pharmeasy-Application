# Online Pharmeasy Application

In this project, me and my team tried to design and implement a database for an online pharmacy application that enables company stores to sell medicines and pharmaceutical products to customers at their preferred locations. The system will allow customers to search for and order medicines online while incorporating all standard features of a modern online pharmacy, including prescription verification, order tracking, and doctor consultations.
